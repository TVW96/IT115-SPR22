Update with more notes from Heather's video: 

1) identify your audience 
2) start with a powerful first sentence
3) tell a compelling story
4) Include a call to action 
5) Wrap it up with personality 


My name is Troy Washington Jr. I am a Year Up student dedicated to becoming a better professional. When I first started the program I did not entirely know what that meant or if someone like myself could be seen as professional, now that I do my goals have become more achievable. One of my many goals for the future are to eventually enable myself to travel while working so I can continue to work on the many different computer sci-fi products I have dreamed of creating. I would also like to open up my proffesional business to international relations.
